JavaScript and TypeScript are two of the most popular programming languages used today. While they offer many benefits, such as flexibility and scalability, they also have some pitfalls that can lead to errors and bugs in our code.

One of the most common pitfalls of JavaScript and TypeScript is that return types don't include errors. This means that when we call a function or method, we don't know if it will return an error or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in our code.

**The Problem with Return Types**

In JavaScript and TypeScript, return types are used to specify the type of value that a function or method returns. However, these return types don't include errors. This means that if a function or method returns an error, it won't be included in the return type.

For example, consider the following code:

```typescript
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero')
  }
  return a / b
}
```

In this example, the `divide` function returns a `number` value. However, if we pass `0` as the second argument, the function will throw an error. But the return type doesn't include this error.

**The Consequences of Ignoring Errors**

Ignoring errors in our return types can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in our code. For example, if we call the `divide` function with `0` as the second argument, it will throw an error. But if we don't handle this error, it can propagate up the call stack and cause unexpected behavior in our application.

**How to Handle Errors in Return Types**

So, how can we handle errors in our return types? One way is to use a union type that includes both the expected return value and the error type. For example:

```typescript
function divide(a: number, b: number): number | Error {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero')
  }
  return a / b
}
```

In this example, the `divide` function returns a union type that includes both `number` and `Error`. This means that if the function returns an error, it will be included in the return type.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, ignoring errors in our return types can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in our code. By using union types that include both the expected return value and the error type, we can handle errors in a more robust way. This can help us write more reliable and maintainable code.
