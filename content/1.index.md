# Hi there!

## I'm a senior web developer with over 7 years of experience crafting web experiences in the tech industry.

I'm obsessed with coding, spending most of my time building high-performance and accessible web applications with **Vue** and **Nuxt** that truly shine. My portfolio is a collection of projects that showcase my skills, the challenges I've tackled head-on, and the knowledge I've amassed over the years.
