# Creating a Circular Menu Animation with Vue.js and CSS clipPath

::text-animation
In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a circular menu animation using Vue.js and the CSS clipPath property. This technique can be used to create a visually pleasing effect where a menu appears to expand from a point and then contract back into it.

## The Code
Here's the Vue.js code snippet we'll be discussing:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const show = ref(false)
const x = ref(50)
const y = ref(50)
const endRadius = ref(100)

function toggleMenu() {
  show.value = !show.value
}
</script>

<template>
  <div
    id="menu"
    :style="{
      clipPath: !show
        ? `circle(0px at calc(${x}px - 0.75rem) calc(${y}px - 0.75rem))`
        : `circle(${endRadius}px at calc(${x}px - 0.75rem) calc(${y}px - 0.75rem))`,
    }"
  >
    <!-- menu items here -->
  </div>
  <button @click="toggleMenu">
    Toggle Menu
  </button>
</template>
```

## How It Works

This code uses the CSS `clipPath` property to create a circular mask for the menu animation. The mask starts as a circle with a radius of 0px when the menu is not shown (`show` is `false`), and expands to a circle with a radius of `endRadius` pixels when the menu is shown (`show` is `true`). The center of the circle is positioned at (`x` - 0.75rem, `y` - 0.75rem).

### When the Menu is Hidden

When `show` is `false`, the `clipPath` property is set to `circle(0px at calc(${x}px - 0.75rem) calc(${y}px - 0.75rem))`. This creates a circle with a radius of 0px, effectively hiding the menu because the circle doesn't cover any part of it.

### When the Menu is Shown

When `show` is `true`, the `clipPath` property is set to `circle(${endRadius}px at calc(${x}px - 0.75rem) calc(${y}px - 0.75rem))`. This creates a circle with a radius of `endRadius` pixels, revealing the menu because the circle covers it.

### Positioning the Circle

The `calc(${x}px - 0.75rem)` `calc(${y}px - 0.75rem)` part of the `clipPath` property determines the center of the circle. The `calc()` function is used to subtract 0.75rem from the `x` and `y` coordinates, positioning the center of the circle.

### Animating the Transition

As the value of `show` changes (for example, when a user clicks a button to open or close the menu), Vue.js automatically updates the `clipPath` property, causing the circle to expand or contract and creating the animation effect. The transition between the two states can be animated using CSS transitions or animations on the `clipPath` property. This isn't shown in the selected code, but it's a common technique to smooth out the change and create a more pleasing visual effect.

## Conclusion

With Vue.js and CSS `clipPath`, you can create interesting and visually pleasing animations for your web applications. This technique of using a circular mask for a menu animation is just one example of what you can do. Happy coding!
